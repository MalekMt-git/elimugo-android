DEAN ElimuGo is an Android application intended to retrieve, present and share  educational content. Itâ€™s purpose is to provide a simple and easy accessible application that provides both Internet based, ElimuPi WiFi network and peer-to-peer data access.  

The application shares (educational) content in environments where internet connectivity is not available, slow and/or expensive. As content can be sizable (MP4 videos, MP3 audio, etc) the available sharing options try to utilize local resources and only use direct internet connections when explicitly selected. 

By allowing local file transfers content can be shared and people can view them by using the DKC application.
